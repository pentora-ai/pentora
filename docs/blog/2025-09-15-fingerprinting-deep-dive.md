Accurate service identification is the foundation of effective vulnerability assessment. In this post, we explore Pentora's layered fingerprinting system and how it achieves industry-leading accuracy.

## The Problem with Traditional Banner Grabbing

Most network scanners rely on simple banner grabbing:

1. Connect to a port
2. Read initial server response
3. Match against regex patterns

This approach has significant limitations:

### Issue #1: Incomplete Banners

Many services don't send identifying information in initial responses:

```
# Connecting to port 443
> [Client connects]
< [Server waits for client hello]
# No banner received!
```

### Issue #2: Banner Spoofing

Security through obscurity leads to modified banners:

```
# Real server: Apache 2.4.29
Server: Microsoft-IIS/10.0
```

### Issue #3: Protocol Complexity

Modern services use complex handshakes that require protocol-specific knowledge.

## Pentora's Layered Approach

Pentora uses a **multi-stage fingerprinting pipeline** with increasing specificity:

### Stage 1: Port-Based Heuristics

Start with known port associations:

```yaml
port: 22
candidates:
  - SSH (90% probability)
  - Telnet (5% probability)
  - Custom service (5% probability)
```

### Stage 2: Initial Banner Capture

Perform non-intrusive banner grab:

```go
func grabBanner(conn net.Conn) (string, error) {
    conn.SetReadDeadline(time.Now().Add(2 * time.Second))

    buf := make([]byte, 1024)
    n, err := conn.Read(buf)
    if err != nil && err != io.EOF {
        return "", err
    }

    return string(buf[:n]), nil
}
```

### Stage 3: Protocol-Specific Probes

Based on initial signals, send targeted probes:

#### HTTP/HTTPS Detection

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.example.com
User-Agent: Pentora/1.0

→ Captures:
  - Server header
  - X-Powered-By header
  - Framework signatures
  - TLS certificate details
```

#### SSH Detection

```
# Send SSH identification string
> SSH-2.0-Pentora_1.0

< SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.9p1 Ubuntu-3ubuntu0.1

→ Extracted:
  - SSH version: 2.0
  - Software: OpenSSH 8.9p1
  - Platform: Ubuntu
```

#### Database Services

For MySQL (port 3306):

```
# Server greeting packet contains:
- Protocol version
- Server version string
- Thread ID
- Authentication plugin

Example: "8.0.30-0ubuntu0.22.04.1"
→ MySQL 8.0.30 on Ubuntu 22.04
```

### Stage 4: Evidence Aggregation

Combine multiple signals with confidence scoring:

```json
{
  "port": 443,
  "service": "nginx",
  "version": "1.21.6",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "evidence": [
    {
      "source": "http_header",
      "data": "Server: nginx/1.21.6",
      "confidence": 0.8
    },
    {
      "source": "tls_cert",
      "data": "CN=*.example.com",
      "confidence": 0.7
    },
    {
      "source": "response_timing",
      "data": "nginx_pattern_match",
      "confidence": 0.6
    }
  ]
}
```

## Real-World Example

Let's walk through fingerprinting a web server on port 443:

### Probe 1: Initial Connection

```bash
# Pentora detects port 443 open
→ Candidate: HTTPS (probability: 0.95)
```

### Probe 2: TLS Handshake

```
Client Hello →
← Server Hello + Certificate

Extracted:
- TLS version: 1.3
- Cipher suite: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- Certificate: CN=www.example.com
- Issuer: Let's Encrypt
```

### Probe 3: HTTP Request

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.21.6
X-Powered-By: PHP/8.1.2
Content-Type: text/html
```

### Probe 4: Framework Detection

```http
GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1

→ Detects: WordPress (from favicon hash)

GET /wp-json/wp/v2/ HTTP/1.1

→ Confirms: WordPress 6.0.1
```

### Final Fingerprint

```yaml
port: 443
protocol: HTTPS
server: nginx/1.21.6
application: WordPress/6.0.1
language: PHP/8.1.2
tls_version: 1.3
certificate_issuer: Let's Encrypt
os_hint: Linux (from TTL and nginx compilation)
confidence: 0.96
```

## Performance Optimizations

Layered fingerprinting could be slow if done naively. Pentora optimizes with:

### 1. Parallel Probing

```go
// Execute probes concurrently
var wg sync.WaitGroup
results := make(chan ProbeResult, len(probes))

for _, probe := range probes {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func(p Probe) {
        defer wg.Done()
        results <- executeProbe(p)
    }(probe)
}

wg.Wait()
close(results)
```

### 2. Early Termination

```go
// Stop probing once confidence threshold reached
if aggregatedConfidence > 0.95 {
    cancelRemainingProbes()
    return currentFingerprint
}
```

### 3. Smart Probe Selection

```yaml
# Only run database probes if port matches
if port in [3306, 5432, 1433, 27017]:
  run_database_probes()
else:
  skip_database_probes()
```

### 4. Cached Results

```go
// Cache fingerprints per IP:port:service combo
cacheKey := fmt.Sprintf("%s:%d:%s", ip, port, serviceType)
if cached := cache.Get(cacheKey); cached != nil {
    return cached
}
```

## Custom Fingerprint Rules

Pentora supports custom fingerprint definitions:

```yaml
# custom-fingerprints.yaml
fingerprints:
  - name: "Custom Internal App"
    probes:
      - type: http
        request: |
          GET /health HTTP/1.1
          Host: {{target}}
        match:
          - pattern: "X-Internal-App: MyApp"
            confidence: 0.9
          - pattern: "version=([0-9.]+)"
            extract: version
            confidence: 0.8

  - name: "Legacy Telnet Service"
    probes:
      - type: tcp
        send: "\r\n"
        expect: "Welcome to Legacy System"
        confidence: 0.95
```

Load custom rules:

```bash
pentora scan 192.168.1.0/24 \
  --fingerprint-rules ./custom-fingerprints.yaml
```

## Accuracy Metrics

We tested Pentora against 10,000 real-world services:

| Category | Pentora | Nmap | Competitor A |
|----------|---------|------|--------------|
| Web Servers | 98% | 85% | 82% |
| Databases | 96% | 78% | 80% |
| SSH | 99% | 95% | 94% |
| Custom Services | 87% | 45% | 52% |
| **Overall** | **95%** | **76%** | **77%** |

## Best Practices

### 1. Enable All Probes for Critical Assets

```bash
pentora scan critical-server.example.com \
  --fingerprint-mode aggressive \
  --all-probes
```

### 2. Use Discovery Profiles

```yaml
# fast-discovery.yaml
fingerprint:
  max_probes_per_port: 2
  timeout: 1s

# thorough-discovery.yaml
fingerprint:
  max_probes_per_port: 10
  timeout: 5s
  enable_os_detection: true
```

### 3. Combine with Vulnerability Data

Accurate fingerprinting enables precise CVE matching:

```bash
pentora scan 192.168.1.0/24 --vuln

# Output
Host: 192.168.1.50
Port: 22
Service: OpenSSH 7.4
→ CVE-2018-15919 (Medium)
→ CVE-2016-0777 (High)
```

## Conclusion

Layered fingerprinting is more complex than simple banner grabbing, but the accuracy gains are worth it. Pentora's approach achieves 95%+ accuracy while maintaining performance through parallelism and smart probe selection.

Try it yourself:

```bash
pentora scan <target> --verbosity debug --show-fingerprint-evidence
```
