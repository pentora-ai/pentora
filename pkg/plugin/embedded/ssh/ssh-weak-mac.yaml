# Trigger when SSH MAC algorithms are detected
triggers:
  - data_key: ssh.mac_algorithms
    condition: exists
    value: true

# Detect weak MAC algorithms
match:
  logic: OR
  rules:
    - field: ssh.mac_algorithms
      operator: contains
      value: "hmac-md5"
    - field: ssh.mac_algorithms
      operator: contains
      value: "hmac-md5-96"
    - field: ssh.mac_algorithms

    - field: ssh.mac_algorithms
      operator: contains
      value: "umac-64@openssh.com"

output:
  vulnerability: true
  severity: medium
  message: "SSH server supports weak MAC algorithms (MD5 or truncated HMAC)"
  remediation: "Disable weak MAC algorithms. Use hmac-sha2-256, hmac-sha2-512, or umac-128@openssh.com"
