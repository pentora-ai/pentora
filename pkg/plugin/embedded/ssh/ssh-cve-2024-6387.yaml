  remediation: |
    IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

    1. Upgrade OpenSSH to version 9.8p1 or later immediately
    2. If immediate patching is not possible, implement network-level access controls:
       - Restrict SSH access to trusted IP addresses only
       - Use VPN or bastion host for SSH access
       - Enable fail2ban or similar brute-force protection

    3. Verify patch installation:
       ssh -V  # Should show OpenSSH_9.8p1 or later

    4. Distribution-specific updates:
       - RHEL/CentOS: sudo yum update openssh-server
       - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade openssh-server
       - FreeBSD: pkg upgrade openssh-portable

    5. Restart SSH service after upgrade:
       sudo systemctl restart sshd

    6. Monitor logs for exploitation attempts:
       - Look for repeated connection attempts
       - Unusual pre-authentication failures
       - Check /var/log/auth.log or /var/log/secure

    7. Consider additional hardening:
       - Disable password authentication (use key-based only)
       - Enable two-factor authentication
       - Use non-standard SSH port (security through obscurity)
       - Limit LoginGraceTime to 30 seconds in sshd_config
