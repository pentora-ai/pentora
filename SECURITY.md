# Security Policy

Reported vulnerabilities can be found on [cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=pentora).

## Supported Versions

- We usually release 3/4 new versions (e.g. 0.1.0, 0.2.0, 0.3.0) per year.
- Release Candidates are available before the release (e.g. 0.1.0-rc1, 0.1.0-rc2, 0.1.0-rc3, 0.1.0-rc4, before 0.1.0).
- Bug-fixes (e.g. 0.1.1, 0.1.2, 0.2.1, 0.2.3) are released as needed (no additional features are delivered in those versions, bug-fixes only).

Each version is supported until the next one is released (e.g. 0.1.x will be supported until 0.2.0 is out).

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

| Version | Supported          |
